Data Storage
-----------------------

Data to be used in Metatron Discovery can be connected in the two following ways:

By storing imported data into data sources on the internal “Druid” engine (See Section 2.1)

By connecting to a SQL database (See Section 2.2)

Data Storage provides functions to connect such data to Metatron and manage it.
