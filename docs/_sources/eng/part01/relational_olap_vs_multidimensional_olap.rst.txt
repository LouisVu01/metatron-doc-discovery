Relational OLAP vs. Multidimensional OLAP
------------------------------------------

Various cutting-edge systems and methods for big data analysis are applied in
metatron Discovery. Among them, you must understand the concept of the

Discoveryâ€™s multidimensional OLAP system resolves these limits.
